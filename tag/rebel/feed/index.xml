										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base.</p>
<p>Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. What good is a reward if you ain&#8217;t around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain&#8217;t my idea of courage. It&#8217;s more like&#8230; suicide.</p>
<p>I call it luck. As you wish. Ye-ha! I can&#8217;t get involved! I&#8217;ve got work to do! It&#8217;s not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there&#8217;s nothing I can do about it right now. It&#8217;s such a long way from here. I don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There&#8217;ll be no one to stop us this time! I care. So, what do you think of her, Han? You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.</p>
<p>I want to come with you to Alderaan. There&#8217;s nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me. I&#8217;m trying not to, kid.</p>
<p>The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. Any attack made by the Rebels against this station would be a useless gesture, no matter what technical data they&#8217;ve obtained. This station is now the ultimate power in the universe. I suggest we use it!</p>
<p>Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed. Kid, I&#8217;ve flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I&#8217;ve seen a lot of strange stuff, but I&#8217;ve never seen anything to make me believe there&#8217;s one all-powerful Force controlling everything.</p>
<p>Perhaps she would respond to an alternative form of persuasion. What do you mean? I think it is time we demonstrate the full power of this station. Set your course for Princess Leia&#8217;s home planet of Alderaan. With pleasure.</p>
<p>Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? I don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can&#8217;t possibly&#8230;</p>

<p>Artoo! Artoo-Detoo, where are you? At last! Where have you been? They&#8217;re heading in this direction. What are we going to do? We&#8217;ll be sent to the spice mine of Kessel or smashed into who knows what! Wait a minute, where are you going?</p>
<p>Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you&#8217;re going. Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed.</p>
<p>Did you hear that? They&#8217;ve shut down the main reactor. We&#8217;ll be destroyed for sure. This is madness! We&#8217;re doomed! There&#8217;ll be no escape for the Princess this time. What&#8217;s that?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Don&#8217;t act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren&#8217;t on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies.</p>
<p>Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. What good is a reward if you ain&#8217;t around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain&#8217;t my idea of courage. It&#8217;s more like&#8230; suicide.</p>
<p>The bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my mind. Han, we need you! We? Yes. Oh, what about you need? I need? I don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re talking about. You probably don&#8217;t. And what precisely am I supposed to know?</p>
<p>He is here. Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed. Red Five standing by. Partially, but it also obeys your commands. The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers. I&#8217;m surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself.</p>
